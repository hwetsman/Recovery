# Recovery

## Why Recovery

Learning is best done through repitition. However, in real life repeating
behavior has consequences. When learning a new skill where consequences could be
dire, simulation is the best way. This game is intended for people new to
recovery or seeking recovery as a way of simulating the recovery experience.
