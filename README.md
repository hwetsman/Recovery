# Recovery

## Why Recovery

Learning is best done through repitition. However, in real life repeating
behavior has consequences. When learning a new skill where consequences could be
dire, simulation is the best way. This game is intended for people new to
recovery or seeking recovery as a way of simulating the recovery experience.

## Game Setup
Each player gets a starting scenario which tells them their current situation and various game statistics that they can change with their play. As each player moves around the board, they pass their 'home group' which counts as one week of game time. Their weekly income or deficit of chips is updated at the passing of the home group. The player only gets paid when passing the homegroup if they have a sponsor. 

## Personal Inventory
The personal inventory is comprised of both Income items and Costs leading to a net increase or decrease of chips at each homegroup. This weekly income also leads to a Savings of chips that can be depleted by game choices. When Savings reaches zero, the player as relapsed and needs to start again. 
Income sources are meetings, sponsees, and service. Costs are resentments and distractions. 

## Moving Around The Board
Moves are ennumerated by picking a move card. No dice are involved. The move card will have a number from one to 6 and the player (starting at his home group) will move that number of spaces in a clockwise direction. 

## Board Spaces
The board spaces are as follows:

Home Group - Where the player gets paid. If the player is directed to go directly to a square bypassing the Home Group, they are not paid.

Skip Home Group - Landing here, the player gets no income from passing their next Home Group.

Choice - The player is directed to pick a choice card, make a choice, and update their income and costs accordingly.

Service - The player adds a service to their income.

Lose Sponsor - The player loses their sponsor and has no income until they get a new sponsor.

Gain Sponsee - Landing here, the player gains a sponsee.

Gain Sponsor - Landing here, the player gets a new sponsor if they need one.

Chip - Landing here, the player takes a chip for their savings.

Drop Meeting - Landing here, the player drops one meeting from their personal inventory.

Meeting - Landing here, the player gets a chip and moves to the meeting square. If they pass their Home Group, they get paid.

Vacation - On this square, nothing happens, because there is no vacation in recovery.

Treatment/Alumni Weekend - This is where the player goes when they relapse to start over. 'Alumni Weekend' is for landing on this square during a normal move.

Meeting/Just Smelling the Coffee - This is where the player goes when directed to a meeting. 'Just Smellling the coffee' is for landing on this square during a normal move.
